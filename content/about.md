Hello and welcome! My name is Konstantin, also known as d0ntrash on most platforms. I am a student, security researcher and hacker.
I focus on low-level topics such as Linux and Windows internals, embedded systems, and fuzzing.

This is my personal blog where I want to share a few of my mostly security-related projects.
I do this for fun and to force myself to write down what I learned so I don't forget it the week after.
